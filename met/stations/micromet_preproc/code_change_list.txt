Base version of MicroMet PreProcessor created.

Corrected line 534 so if wdir is undef, 360 is not added to wdir.

Modified some of the introductory comments to state that all of the
variables (Tair, RH, wind speed, wind direction, and precipitation)
are assumed to have diurnal cycles, and that this is used in the
filling of missing data for all variables.  If it turns out that
there is no diurnal cycle, this is okay too.

30 Jan 2006
Eliminated the need to have a valid data value for each variable
during the first and last hour of the input data file.  If these
data are undefined, the average of the closest (in time) 24 valid
values are used to fill in the missing value.

30 Jan 2006
Corrected a problem in the main program where undefined values of
rh, wind speed, and precipitation were set to zero.

31 Jan 2006
Modified arima/arima.progs.f (search "TESTING, Glen") used by
preproc_MicroMet.f to eliminate a rare divide by zero.

31 Jan 2006
Implemented routines that fill missing data segments if Case B, C,
and/or D occur (these used to be called Case 2, 3, and 4; but to
avoid confusion with the data-filling Case 1, 2, and 3 procedures,
the numbers were changed to letters; see the code introduction
comments).  Whether this extra filling is done or not is controlled
by a flag in the preproc_MicroMet.par file.  This filling is done
two ways, one preserves diurnal cycles, the other uses averages (so
you will get "flat" lines in the data for this case).

Commented out the call to AMLST to avoid the warning given when
compiling using cygwin (AMLST is not called with the print flags
I am using).

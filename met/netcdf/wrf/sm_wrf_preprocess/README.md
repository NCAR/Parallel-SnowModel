INTRODUCTION  
This directory contains modules, jupyter notebooks, and python scripts for pre-processing netCDF forcing datasets. This is specifically applicable to the WRF netCDF files generated by NCAR from 2000-2013. Additional changes will need to be made to make this more generic for other netCDF files. The python scripts and jupyter notebooks use a Object-Oriented python approach.

REQUIREMENTS  
A list of the required libraries needed to run the jupyter notebooks and python scripts can be viewed in the env/geospatial.yml file. To install these libraries via terminal commands, change directories to env/ and run the following terminal command:  
"conda env create -f geospatial.yml"  
"conda activate geospatial"  

To run python scripts such as "sm_single_main.py" using a batch script on NCAR's Casper supercomputer. Run the following commands in the terminal:  
"module restore python"  -- > or equivalent to make sure python module is loaded  
"conda activate geospatial"  
"qsubcasper netcdf_preprocess.pbs"

1) If you are using Glen's DEM and Landcover archive, your
SnowModel topo and vege file can be built by following the
steps described in:

/NoAm_30m/1_readme_general_topo_vege.txt
/NoAm_30m/2_readme_topo_vege_data_download.txt
/NoAm_30m/3_readme_inputs.txt
/NoAm_30m/4_readme_process_topo_vege.txt
/NoAm_30m/5_readme_input_names_locations.txt

2) If you have other dem and land cover data distributions,
you can modify the steps in /NoAm_30m/* to process you data
like Glen does.  Additional information is provided in:

/NoAm_30m/6_readme_other_topo_vege_datasets.txt

3) If you have your own DEM and Landcover datasets that are
already in the correct format (like ARC/INFO ascii), you can
convert them to a GrADS file using the program in here:

/asc_to_grads/
